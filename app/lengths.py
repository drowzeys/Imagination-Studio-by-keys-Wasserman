"""How long a clip can be: MiniMax H3 and FastH3 take 17n + 5 frames at 24 frames a second, nothing in between.

The app used to offer four lengths (5, 8, 10 and 15 seconds: 124, 192, 243 and 362 frames). Every count from 22
frames (0.92 s) to 362 (15.08 s) is one the model takes, 21 lengths in all, and a job may now ask for any of them:
by `frames`, or by `seconds`, which is brought to the nearest count. 5, 8, 10 and 15 seconds are the same four counts
as before. The seconds a count gives are exact: frames / 24.

The longest clip is the model's own 15 seconds on every preset of both builds. On a DGX Spark that was measured
at the largest canvas (SPARK_LONGEST in server.py: 362 frames at 1376x768 with a first and a last frame left 29.7 GB
of 121 free on TensorFold's int8 engine); the Mac's limits are the ones it had.
