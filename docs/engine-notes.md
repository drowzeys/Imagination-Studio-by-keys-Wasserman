## FastH3 (new in 1.8)

**Credit first: FastVideo / Hao AI Lab** made FastH3 (the distilled weights and the sparse-attention routing they
were trained with), on **MiniMax's** H3. What this pack adds is the attention kernel that makes it fast on a Mac.

```bash
bash scripts/fast.sh "a prompt" out.mp4                      # 480p (864x480), 8 passes
STEPS=4 bash scripts/fast.sh "a prompt" out.mp4              # 4, 8 or 20 passes
RES=720p bash scripts/fast.sh "a prompt" out.mp4             # 1280x720
UPSCALE=1 bash scripts/fast.sh "a prompt" out.mp4            # 480p generated, 2x decoder: 1728x960
RES=720p UPSCALE=1 bash scripts/fast.sh "a prompt" out.mp4   # 720p generated, 2x decoder: 2560x1440 (2K)
# Qwen-Image-2.1 makes the first frame, FastH3 animates it (all the studio.sh presets work: X2=1, TWOK=1, QHD=1)
ENGINE=fasth3 STEPS=8 WIDTH=864 HEIGHT=480 bash scripts/studio.sh "the picture" "what happens" out.mp4
```

In the web app FastH3 is the first card under **Video engine**, with Passes, Resolution and 2x upscale beside it.

Measured on a Mac Studio M5 Ultra (64-core GPU, 256 GB), 5 second clips of 124 frames with sound, one run each,
whole command including model load and decode:

| Output | Generated at | 4 passes | 8 passes | 20 passes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 480p, 864x480 | 864x480 | 51 s | 78 s | 174 s |
| 480p + 2x decoder, 1728x960 | 864x480 | | 88 s | |
| 720p, 1280x720 | 1280x736, cropped | 112 s | 192 s | 434 s |
| 720p + 2x decoder, 2560x1440 | 1280x736, cropped | | 203 s | |

A pass takes 7.1 s at 480p and 19.7 s at 720p; the 2x decoder adds about 10 s. A 10 second 1312x736 clip (243
frames) takes 478 s at 8 passes, against 2,183 s with FastVideo's own Metal kernel in the same engine.

- **8 passes** is what the checkpoint was trained for. **4** and **20** spread that many rungs evenly over the same
  schedule: by eye on one prompt, 4 is a little softer and 20 has more texture. Neither is a setting FastVideo
  trained or tested. FastVideo's dedicated 4-step preview checkpoint was tried too and looked no better than V2 at
  4 passes for the same time, so the pack uses one checkpoint for all three.
- **2x of 480p is 1728x960**, which is above 720p, not exactly 720p. For a 1344x768 clip generated at half size,
  the Turbo path's `X2=1` draft preset does that.
- **Why it is fast.** FastH3 lets each 64-row tile of the video attend to the text and audio rows and to the best
  fifth of the video tiles. The kernel gives one threadgroup one query tile of one head and walks only the chosen
  key tiles, read in place, with int8 scores and values. At 69K rows a block takes 0.52 s against 1.93 s for dense
  attention. The int8 scores pick a few different tiles than FastVideo's float reference would, so details differ
  from its output (cosine 0.9999 on random inputs; not a bit-exact port).
- **Image to video works, though FastVideo trained FastH3 on text to video only.** One test (the baker prompts,
  864x480, 8 passes): the clip opens on the Qwen image, keeps the face and follows the prompt; image 9 s, video
  94 s. The first-frame rows join the rows every video tile always attends to. Not tested widely.
- The sound is FastH3's own; the base-model audio step is not applied here.
- FastH3 weights are a derivative of MiniMax H3 under the MiniMax H3 Community License.

## The native engine (new in 2.0)

**Credit first: Ash Hart and the TensorFold contributors** wrote the TensorFold 1.0 runtime this uses (Zig driving
Metal directly, Apache-2.0), and **FastVideo / Hao AI Lab** made FastH3. What this pack adds is an H3 family for that
runtime: FastH3's block stack, its tile-routed attention and its int8 kernels for the M5 tensor units.

| What | Where it runs |
|---|---|
| FastH3, from text or from a first frame (a Qwen scout, your own image, every part of a long chain): all transformer passes (rows in, 50 blocks, routing, attention, both output heads) | `tf-h3-dit`, the native Zig + Metal program |
| Prompt encoding, the first frame's encoding, the checkpoint's small projections and timestep tables | Python (MLX), once per clip |
| Video decoder, audio decoder, MP4 | Python (MLX), as before |
| Qwen-Image-2.1, the Turbo adapter path, the 20-step path, the base-model audio step | MLX engine, unchanged |

`scripts/video.sh` picks the native engine for a FastH3 clip when it is installed and the chip has tensor units (M5
or later); it prints `[tensorfold] engine: zig` or `engine: mlx (why)`, and the web app
shows the same on the job. `FASTH3_ENGINE=mlx` or `zig` forces one.

Measured on a Mac Studio M5 Ultra (64-core GPU, 256 GB), FastH3 with sound, text to video unless a row says from
an image, one run each, whole command including export and decode unless a row says per pass:

| Clip | Native engine | MLX engine |
|---|---:|---:|
| 864x480, 124 frames, per pass | 5.33 s | 7.12 s |
| 864x480, 5 s, 4 passes | 43 s | 51 s |
| 864x480, 5 s, 8 passes | 66 s | 78 s |
| 864x480, 5 s, 20 passes | 129 s | 174 s |
| 864x480, 124 frames, from a Qwen-Image first frame, per pass | 6.14 s | 8.08 s |
| 864x480, 5 s, 8 passes, from a first frame (image already made) | 72 s | 90 s |
| 1728x960 through the 2x decoder, 5 s, 8 passes, from a first frame | 77 s | not run |
| 18 s chain of two clips, 864x480, 4 passes | 156 s | 183 s |
| 1280x720, 5 s, 8 passes | 199 s | 259 s |
| 1280x720, 10 s (243 frames), 8 passes | 388 s | about 480 s (53 s a pass; not re-run) |
| 1280x720, 10 s (243 frames), 20 passes | about 950 s (45 s a pass plus export and decode) | not run |

The two 1280x720, 5 s figures come from one sitting with another job using the machine on and off, so both are
slower than a quiet run would be (the MLX figure was 192 s when first measured); read them as a ratio.

- **Quality.** The native engine and the MLX engine both use int8 arithmetic and agree with a float reference to the
  same degree on the first pass (video cosine 0.961 and 0.966). The same seed gives the same shot with different
  details, not the same pixels. The clips were judged by eye by the pack's owner; the native engine's attention
  weights are 8-bit.
- **20 passes** is the setting to reach for when a prompt has several distinct actions: in two tests it brought in
  action the 8-pass clip had skipped and removed an object glitch. It is not a setting FastVideo trained.
- **Sizes.** The routing cuts the video into tiles of 4x4x4 tokens (128 pixels a side, 17 frames deep). A size that
  is not whole tiles is padded inside the attention. Rounding the size up instead is not faster at the same length
  (896x512 took 5.75 s a pass against 5.33 s for 864x480 at 124 frames), so the studio generates the size you ask
  for. Lengths of 107, 175, 243 and 311 frames are whole tiles in time; 243 is the 10 second choice.
- **From an image.** A first frame's rows sit between the text and the audio, enter on every pass at the keyframe
  noise level and are never stepped, as in the MLX engine. On the baker test the clip opens on the given image
  (frame 0 against the image: 33.7 dB on both engines) and the first pass agrees with the float reference as closely
  as the MLX engine's does (video cosine 0.995 and 0.997). One image and prompt at 864x480, plus the app tests.
- **Not in the native engine yet:** the prompt encoder, the first-frame encoder, the decoders, Qwen-Image. A Qwen-Image
  transformer for the same runtime exists in the fork and is level with the MLX one (0.483 s against 0.477 s a pass
  at 1344x768), so the studio keeps the MLX one.
- **Install.** `oneshot-setup.sh` copies the engine from the carrier image's payload (a 0.7 MB program, its Metal
  kernels inside it, compiled when it starts). Without Docker it builds from source if `zig` 0.17 and Xcode's Metal
  toolchain are present (`scripts/build-zig-engine.sh`); with neither, FastH3 stays on the MLX engine and everything
  still works.

## How it works

1. **You write two prompts**: what the picture shows, and what happens in the clip (action, spoken or sung words,
   sound).
2. **Qwen-Image-2.1-Turbo makes the first frame** from the first prompt, in about 9 seconds (8 steps). Or it
   makes several scouts for you to choose from.
3. **MiniMax H3 animates that frame** from the second prompt, with sound, in one of two modes:
   - **Standard (Turbo 5).** The Turbo adapter denoises picture and sound together in 5 passes. The adapter is then
     dropped and the base model denoises the sound again from scratch, 20 steps, with the finished picture held
     fixed. Each of those steps recomputes only the audio rows (about 4% of the sequence) against the picture's
     stored attention keys and values, so 20 steps cost less than one full pass.
   - **High quality (`QUALITY=high`).** The base model denoises picture and sound together for 20 steps, no adapter.
     About three times slower; calmer motion, softer picture, and the sound the standard mode's audio step is
     borrowed from.
4. **The decoders finish it.** The video decoder turns latents into frames, optionally at twice the size (the 2x
   decoder, for 2K). The audio decoder's output is kept clear of clipping, and a take that comes out thin gets its
   bass lifted.

Both transformers, the samplers, the adapter merges, the audio step, the int8 kernels and the image and video
decoders run in TensorFold on MLX.

**Scout, pick, animate, finish in 2K.** Six scout images from one prompt in 27 seconds; pick one; MiniMax H3 animates
it with sound and a 2x decoder finishes it in 2K: an 8 second clip at 2048x1152 in five minutes, or at 2560x1440 in
under eleven. A 1344x768 draft of the same 8 seconds takes 108 seconds.

## The base-model audio step

*This section and the Turbo rows in "How it works" and "Measured" describe MiniMax H3 Turbo, which since 2.1 is
installed only with `oneshot-setup.sh --turbo`. FastH3, the default, makes its picture and sound together.*

The Turbo adapter is what makes the picture fast, and it is also what spoils the sound. So the sound is made twice:
once with the picture, by the adapter, and thrown away; then again by the base model, which is the one that sounds
right.

1. After the Turbo passes, the adapter-merged model is unloaded and the released weights are loaded (4 s).
2. The finished picture, the first frame and the prompt go through the model once, held still, and every block's
   attention keys and values over them are stored.
3. The audio starts again from noise and is denoised in 20 steps. Each step runs only the audio rows (1,206 of 29,009
   on a 15 second clip) against the stored keys and values: about 1.3 s a step instead of 24 s.

It is on by default whenever the adapter is used. `REVOICE=0` keeps the adapter's own sound; `REVOICE=<steps>` sets the
number of audio steps (20 is the only value tried). It was offered upstream (ashhart/TensorFold#405) and closed with the H3 family; it lives in the fork.

## The workflow

```bash
# 1. Scout: several first frames from one prompt, one model load (27 s for six), with a contact sheet
bash scripts/scout.sh "A lighthouse keeper in a yellow raincoat on a cliff at dusk, storm clouds behind him" 6 scouts/keeper
open scouts/keeper/sheet.jpg

# 2. Draft the motion from the one you like: 8 s at 1344x768 in under two minutes
IMAGE_FILE=scouts/keeper/scout_s3.png X2=1 FRAMES=192 bash scripts/studio.sh "" \
    "He raises a lantern, wind pulls at his coat, waves crash below. He says: Storm's coming." draft.mp4

# 3. Finish in 2K: same image, same prompt. TWOK=1 is 2048x1152 (5 min), QHD=1 is 2560x1440 (11 min)
IMAGE_FILE=scouts/keeper/scout_s3.png QHD=1 FRAMES=192 bash scripts/studio.sh "" \
    "He raises a lantern, wind pulls at his coat, waves crash below. He says: Storm's coming." final.mp4
```

Or all at once, with no picking: `TWOK=1 bash scripts/studio.sh "the picture" "what happens" out.mp4`.

- **Scouts are made at 1280x736**, which is exactly the frame the video model starts from for a 2560x1440 clip, so
  the scout you pick is the frame the clip opens on, with no resize in between.
- **Why 736 and not 720.** The video model needs sides in multiples of 32, and 720 is not one. The 2K preset
  generates at 1280x736, decodes at 2x to 2560x1472 and centre-crops 16 rows top and bottom to 2560x1440.
- **The draft and the final are different renders.** The draft generates at 672x384 and the final at 1280x736, so the
  motion is similar in kind, not frame for frame.

## Notes

- **Licences decide what you may do with this.** Qwen-Image-2.1-Turbo (and Qwen-Image-2.1 with the Viggle adapter) are under the **Qwen Research
  License Agreement: non-commercial research and evaluation only**; commercial use needs a licence from the Qwen
  team. MiniMax H3 and the 2x decoder derived from it are under the MiniMax H3 Community License, which excludes some
  territories. This pack ships no
  weights. Read both licences before downloading.
- **Render through Studio's scripts/backends, not `tensorfold serve`.** The app queues work; ComfyUI and the
  Voice/Music/brain engines can stay warm under their owned lifecycles. The image-to-video chain runs its models
  sequentially, not together.
- **What TensorFold runs and what it borrows.** Both transformers, both samplers, the adapter merges, the int8
  kernels, the image decoder and the video decoder are TensorFold's. The Qwen-Image prompt encoder is mflux's, and
  the H3 text encoder, first-frame encoder, audio decoder and MP4 writer are minimax-h3-mlx's.
- **Picture editing is a separate route.** Qwen and FLUX3-K have edit workflows; MOSS-Image is text-to-image only.
  Generation qualification does not qualify editing. See [Edit a picture](user-guide.md#edit-a-picture).
- **Sound (1.5).** With the Turbo adapter the sound was judged poor by ear: harsh on speech, worse on singing, with an
  echo-like quality. Measurements agree on one cause: the model makes two audio channels, which agree at 20 steps
  and disagree under the adapter. More passes, a mono fold-down, level changes and a different audio schedule did
  not fix it. Making the sound again with the base model did, and is now standard (`REVOICE=0` keeps the adapter's
  sound). The fast audio step is not identical to recomputing the whole sequence each step: on one clip the two
  gave the same loudness contour and tone but not the same waveform. Lip-sync was judged by eye, not measured.
- **Levels.** The audio decoder's hard clip at full scale is lifted and an overshooting take is turned down as a
  whole. A take whose 120-300 Hz band is weak gets a low shelf of up to 6 dB (`AUDIO_EQ=off` skips it); re-voiced
  takes have needed 2.5 to 5 dB.
- **Passes.** On a 15 second (362 frame) clip, 3 passes lost a detail (headphones) that 4, 5 and 6 kept, and 5 was
  preferred by eye. On an 8 second (192 frame) clip 3 passes kept it. `POINTS` sets passes plus one.
- **Quality is not graded.** Checked: stills of every clip, the scripted line by speech recognition, one image prompt
  against the mflux reference. Not checked: motion and audio by eye and ear, lip-sync, text rendering in general
  (the chalkboard reads "FRESH TODAY" at 1344x768 and comes out garbled at 864x480), other prompts and seeds.
- **Turbo adapters are distilled models.** They trade some fidelity for speed; `TURBO=0` (image) and `QUALITY=high`
  (video) run the base models.
- **M5 only for these Metal timings.** Metal tensor-unit kernels need an M5-family chip; CUDA uses its own kernels.
  M1–M4 use the documented MLX path, including the supported 8-bit FastH3 option.
- **Memory.** `--image-only` asks for 48 GB; the default install 96 GB (64 GB up to 4.3.0); `--turbo` and `--ref2va` 128 GB. Measured on 256 GB only; see [Minimum requirements](installation.md#minimum-requirements).
- **Historical upstream work (2026-10-07).** The H3 family, the Qwen-Image family and the audio step were offered to
  ashhart/TensorFold as draft pull requests (ashhart/TensorFold#384, ashhart/TensorFold#393, ashhart/TensorFold#405)
  and closed on 2026-10-07: the engine was built around
  token lanes with exact output, it does not trade precision as the int8 kernels do, its Python engine is frozen and
  its new Zig engine drove Metal without MLX. Current engine pins are platform-specific; see the setup scripts
  rather than using this historical paragraph as a current version inventory.
- **Tests.** Use the focused tests for the changed platform/feature. Page tests need Node 20+ (skipped without it).
  Automated Windows inventories are isolated by default; real hardware checks and render qualification are
  separate explicit operations. See [the Windows runbook](windows-rtx-spark-testing.md).
